inst-trans
==========

The project's goal is to provide translation of words or text just by clicking.
The system will work click emulating mouse clicks and copying the content to the clipboard, where it will be captured for the application.

As the content of the translation from a remote source comes a cache system will be implemented, reducing overhead on the network connections.

Still under development, so all features will be implemented.


Project written in python, using as PySide GUI.
